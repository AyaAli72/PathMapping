# PathMapping – Autonomous Path Planning Project

This project focuses on implementing path planning and mapping algorithms for autonomous navigation systems. It demonstrates how a robot or agent can navigate safely from a start point to a goal while avoiding obstacles in a simulated environment.

## Overview

The project applies sampling-based path planning techniques to generate efficient and collision-free paths. It emphasizes algorithm performance, obstacle avoidance, and path visualization for autonomous navigation use cases.

## Features

- RRT and RRT* based path planning
- Obstacle-aware navigation and collision avoidance
- Path optimization and cost evaluation
- Visual representation of environments and planned paths

## Technologies Used
